# Jobba: The Hunt 

You find yourself in a room...

In the room is a pile of filthy straw, an old wooden bucket, and a few gnawed bones.

You have been imprisoned by the evil No Jobba. To escape the dungeon of Uhnimploid, you must equip yourself and slay his minions. This isâ€¦Jobba: The Hunt.

Or The Job Slayer. We haven't decided yet.


Git the bucket is the bucketedsedsed!


Look at the wall.  There is a picture of a dancing hamster.

Git the bucket.

This is my push!


>I'm sorry, I don't understand "Git the bucket."

Get the bucket.
>You pick up the bucket. It smells like sadness.
